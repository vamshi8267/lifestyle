Core Azure Services: An Azure App Service Plan defines the infrastructure and pricing tier for hosting your apps in Azure. It determines the compute resources allocated for running your applications, such as CPU, memory, and storage. Multiple apps can share the same plan, optimizing resource usage. Plans are customizable and scale easily based on performance needs.

Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends. It supports multiple programming languages, including .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, and more. App Service integrates with DevOps tools and provides built-in features like high availability, auto-scaling, and security compliance.
