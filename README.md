This problem is evident in the limited availability of proper facilities, the scarcity of the expert coaching and the absence of comprehensive training programs tailored to athlete’s needs. The indoor sports academy’s basic purpose and functionality are directly mapped to the problem statement or the opportunity area it aims to address. The core purpose of the academy is to provide accessible and high-quality training facilities for athletes, which aligns with the identified problem statement or opportunity area of the lack of such facilities in the community.
